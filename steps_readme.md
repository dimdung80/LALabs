# Building a Serverless Application Using Step Functions, API Gateway, Lambda, and S3 in AWS
## Introduction
In this AWS hands-on lab, we will create a fully working serverless reminder application using S3, Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions, Simple Email Service, and Simple Notification Service.

While the lab does use Python and JavaScript, you don't need to be able to code to understand and implement the solution. By the end of the lab, you will feel more comfortable architecting and implementing serverless solutions within AWS.

Let's get started!

## Solution
Log in to the live AWS environment using the credentials provided. Make sure you're in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) region throughout the lab.
