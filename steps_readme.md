Introduction
In this AWS hands-on lab, we will create a fully working serverless reminder application using S3, Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions, Simple Email Service, and Simple Notification Service.

While the lab does use Python and JavaScript, you don't need to be able to code to understand and implement the solution. By the end of the lab, you will feel more comfortable architecting and implementing serverless solutions within AWS.

Let's get started!

Solution
Log in to the live AWS environment using the credentials provided. Make sure you're in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) region throughout the lab.

In a new browser tab, open the GitHub repo for this lab.
Click the api_handler.py file.
Click Raw to display the raw function code.
Copy the code.
Return to the AWS Lambda console, and paste the copied code in to lambda_function.py.
Click Deploy. Keep this tab open.
Create a Step Function State Machine
In a new browser tab, navigate to the Step Functions.
Click Get started to run the Hello World example.
In the line under the Review Hello World example title, click here to access more functionality. (Click Leave if prompted with a warning, and then click here again.)
Select Write your workflow in code.
Under Type, select Standard.
Return to the GitHub repo, and click the step-function-template.json file.
Click Raw, and copy the code.
Return to Step Functions, and under Definition, delete the current contents and replace it with your copied code.
On lines 34 and 52, replace the Resource placeholder value with the copied ARN for email.
On lines 40 and 62, replace the Resource placeholder value with the copied ARN for sms.
Click the refresh icon to the right of the code to view the updated function diagram.
Click Next.
Under Permissions, select Choose an existing role.
Under Existing roles, select RoleForStepFunction.
Scroll to the bottom, and click Create state machine.
Under Details, copy the ARN.
Return to Lambda, and select Functions > api_handler.
Scroll down to Code source and double-click lambda_function.py.
On line 6, replace the SFN_ARN placeholder value with the ARN you just copied.
Click Deploy.
Create the API Gateway
In the AWS Management Console, navigate to API Gateway.
Click Get Started, and then click OK.
Under REST API (not the Private one), select Build.
Under Choose the protocol, select REST.

Click Create Resource.
With /reminders selected, click Actions > Create Method.
In the new dropdown under /reminders, select POST and click the adjacent checkmark icon.
In /reminders - POST - Setup, set the following values:

Create the Static S3 Website
Return to the GitHub repo, and download a local copy of the static_website folder with its file contents. You can go to the static_website folder and download a copy of each file, or you can go to the main repository, click Code, and select Download ZIP to get all of the files in the repo.
In your local static_website folder, open the formlogic.js file.
On line 5, delete the API_ENDPOINT placeholder text, and paste in the Invoke URL you previously copied from API Gateway, keeping /reminders on the end of the string:

var API_ENDPOINT = 'UPDATETOYOURINVOKEURLENDPOINT/reminders';
In the AWS Management Console, navigate to S3.
